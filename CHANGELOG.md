# Supersonic Changelog

Issues are tracked in AppGyver's [unified issue tracker](https://github.com/appgyver/steroids/issues) – please post bug reports and feature requests there.

## 1.9.1 (2015-12-10)

Fixes:

- Prevents module attributes from outside a modal module iframe leaking into the modal in web.

## 1.9.0 (2015-12-02)

Features:

- `whenChanged` methods in `supersonic.data.model` support an error callback argument

Changes:

- `whenChanged` will stop polling for updates if an unrecoverable error (HTTP 4xx) is encountered

## 1.8.9 (2015-11-10)

Fixes:
- Module soft tabs fixed to work in chrome/android.

## 1.8.8 (2015-11-06)

Fixes:

  Issue: [XWALK-5621](https://crosswalk-project.org/jira/browse/XWALK-5621)

## 1.8.7 (2015-11-05)

Fixes:

## 1.8.6 (2015-10-30)

Tabs for composer 2

Features:

## 1.8.5 (2015-10-28)

Improves the time to getting refreshed data from `whenChanged`.

Changes:
- `supersonic.data.model` instances use a different polling logic for `whenChanged` by default. Pollers are started when the view is visible and stopped while the view is hidden.
- The default polling interval for `supersonic.data.model` instances is 1000ms (down from 10000ms) when caching is enabled.

## 1.8.4 (2015-10-27)

Changes:
- Composer2 modules will check for http://localhost workaround only on Android.

Fixes:
- Prevents an issue with the `localStorage` cache adapter from preventing `supersonic.data` cache expirations.


## 1.8.3 (2015-10-26)

Changes:
- Support for deferred loading of iframes via the `ag-src` property. Circumvents an issue with requests to `localhost` on Android.

## 1.8.2 (2015-10-21)

Changes:
- Support for blocking UI interactions while there are `supersonic.data` requests ongoing. Requires iOS client version 4.0.7 or Android client version 4.1.0.

## 1.8.1 (2015-10-14)

Changes:
- Files uploaded via `supersonic.data` get additional metadata stored, containing their mimetype, and get a filename determined based on the file uploaded instead of using an automatically generated one.

## 1.8.0 (2015-10-09)

Features:
- Adds the `supersonic.module.notifications` namespace for sending out notification events from Composer modules

## 1.7.10 (2015-10-02)

Fix:
- Bring back some module APIs which were made private in 1.7.8.

## 1.7.9 (2015-10-02)

Features:
- Enhanced uploading can be requested with `X-AG-Image-Uploader` headers:
  - Display a native progress bar on upload.
  - Transparently resize uploaded PNG and JPEG images.
  - See example usage in `testApp`.

Changes:
- Set Module runtime's initial visibility on DOM Content Loaded event.

## 1.7.8 (2015-09-30)

Changes:
- Hide the module container instead of the module iframe itself.
  Module might have external chrome which needs to be hidden also to
  prevent blinking.

## 1.7.7 (2015-09-29)

Features:
- Remove from the DOM Composer modules which are not currently visible.
  For example:
  - on `layers.push()` hide modules on the previous layer and bring
  them back on `layers.pop()`.
  - hide modules on Tab A when navigating to Tab B.
- `supersonic.ui.dialog.spinner.*` displays a spinner which can block either
  the current webview or the whole app.
- PreviewFileView now supports remote URLs
- New API to display a media gallery:
~~~
  mediaGallery = new supersonic.ui.MediaGallery([
    "http://www.mydomain.com/images/promo01.jpg"
    "images/floor_plan.jpg"
    "videos/movie.mp4"])

  mediaGallery.start()
~~~

## 1.7.6 (2015-09-15)

Fixes:
- `supersonic.data.model` cache inconsistencies ([closes issue #1022](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/1022))

## 1.7.5 (2015-09-10)

Features:

Fixes:
- Loading spinner fors Composer Module iframes are removed after frame document body is available. Prevents stale spinners.

Features:
- Composer Module iframes waiting for loading to complete show a loading indicator.
- `supersonic.module` navigation functions that accept routes now accept references to the current module's views as `#view-name`.

Changes:
- When supersonic runs in a Composer Module iframe, cordova and steroids from the parent frame will be used.

## 1.6.11 (2015-08-24)

Fixes:
- Add delay to catch fully rendered static modules for correct resizing.

## 1.6.10 (2015-08-21)

Fixes:
- Composer Module iframe sizes automatically scale according to their content height

## 1.6.8 (2015-08-21)

Fixes:
- `supersonic.data.channel` uses `postMessage` from `window.top` to ensure message propagation from Composer Modules
- `supersonic.module.attributes` looks for attributes from both `window` and `window.parent`
- Behavior of navigation APIs in `supersonic.module` improved to enable compatibility with the Composer Module web development harness in Steroids Connect

## 1.6.7 (2015-08-17)

- `supersonic.module.router` maps Composer Module route to installed Modules
- `supersonic.module.layers` allows pushing and popping Module views from the view stack based on routes

## 1.5.11 (2015-07-03)

Fixes:
- Switch the default `supersonic.data` cache adapter for a functioning one. The defective adapter caused caching to be effectively disabled.

## 1.5.10 (2015-07-02)

Features:
- `supersonic.module.transitions` provides view transition animations for Composer Modules

## 1.5.9 (2015-06-17)

Changes:
- Saving a Supersonic Data model instance merges the server response to the instance instead of replacing the whole instance state.

Fixes:
- Prevented the potential for a state leak in the HTTP layer of Supersonic Data. `X-Job-Id` headers would get reused by accident in some scenarios.

## 1.5.8 (2015-06-16)

Pre-features:
- Enabling/Disabling the Drawer via API. Closes [#749](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/749). *Note: This feature requires wrapper support, which will be out shortly. Until then, the API calls will not work.*

## 1.5.7 (2015-06-08)
Changes:
- Updated Supersonic CSS to match Ionic's v1.0.0 "uranium-unicorn" release.

Breaking Changes:
- Updated Ionicons to v2.0.1. Naming convention for iOS icons changed from `<icon prefix>-ios7-<icon name>` to `<icon prefix>-ios-<icon name>`.

*Note: These updates include minor cosmetic tweaks to the UI – nothing major. That said, you might still want to check your app to ensure everything looks as it should after the update. For those interested, full list of changes can be found in [this commit](https://github.com/AppGyver/supersonic/commit/3b4fd6059bddf23ea0fff06617b6525f8090977d).*

Bunch of outstanding issues in Steroids.js and other components fixed or made obsolete by Supersonic features:

- The `network.extraResponseHeaders` property in `config/app.coffee` can be used to set custom headers that will be appended to all incoming HTTP responses, allowing e.g. CORS issues to be circumvented for good. iOS-only for the moment, fixes [#124](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/124), [#140](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/140) and [#150](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/150) for iOS.
- New app configs at `config/app.coffee` and `config/structure.coffee` deprecate `config/application.coffee` and the various `config.xml` files. Closes [#194](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/194) and [#175](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/175).
- New http://docs.appgyver.com sources are public on [GitHub](https://github.com/AppGyver/supersonic/tree/master/docs). Closes [#237](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/237).
- Supersonic Routes remove the need for explicit view URLs. Closes [#285](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/285).
- Deprecated keyboard `config.ios.xml` settings, since the new keyboard plugin introduced in [iOS runtime v4.0.0](https://github.com/AppGyver/scanner/blob/master/changelog-ios.md#400-2014-10-10-native-css-with-pixate) no longer supports them. Closes [#101](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/101) and [#208](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/208)
