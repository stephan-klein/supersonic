#Supersonic Web Components

Supersonic utilizes [Web Components](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/) to provide easily reusable HTML elements for your app. With web components it's possible to define new HTML elements that can be used in your code in a similar way to, for example, a `<div>` tag.

##Web Components and structuring your app

A very often repeated element in mobile applications is a navigation bar. One can be created with simple HTML, but it will lack the functionality and seamlessness of a native implementation. The Supersonic navigation bar however has the benefit of both approaches. To define a navigation bar just add

```html
<ss-navigation-bar>
  <ss-navigation-bar-title>
    I'm a native navigation bar!
  </ss-navigation-bar-title>
</ss-navigation-bar>
```

to the HTML file you want to include a navigation bar in. Now, if you run your project, you will see a navigation bar appear at the top of the app. It might seem a bit too simple to work, but there's actually a lot going on under the hood. The `<ss-navigation-bar>` element maps to the native interface and creates a fully native navigation bar in your app.
